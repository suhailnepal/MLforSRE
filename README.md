POC for ML training for IT Operations

## Objective

The goal of this project is to build a machine learning classifier that can categorise IT operations tickets based on historical incident data. 

The model will be trained on curated, tagged data and evaluated using [Scikit-Learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) which is ML algorithm written in Python. 


## High Level Approach

1. Data Collection & Preprocessing (For this project we create dummy data (IT operations))
   *  For simplicity, created a incident file (incidents.csv), Description and Fields
   * 

## Things to consider

Evaluation Metrics: Precision, recall, F1-score, confusion matrix
Deployment: FastAPI, Flask, Docker (optional)
LLMs vs Traditional ML: If the dataset is large, LLMs can enhance contextual understanding.
