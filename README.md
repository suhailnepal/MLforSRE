POC for ML training for IT Operations

## Objective

The goal of this project is to build a machine learning classifier that can categorise IT operations tickets based on historical incident data. 

The model will be trained on curated, tagged data and evaluated (using precision, recall, and F1-scor) to ensure its accuracy.

## High Level Approach

1. Data Collection & Preprocessing (For this project we create dummy data (IT operations) generated by OpenAI)
    * Collect historical IT incident tickets and label them into predefined categories.
    * Store data in CSV/JSON format for easy processing.
    * Perform data cleaning: Remove duplicates, handle missing values, and standardize text fields.
    * Extract features from unstructured text using TF-IDF or word embeddings.

1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
    * Identify key patterns and correlations in the dataset.
    * Visualise ticket distribution by category.
    * Perform word cloud analysis of common incident terms.

1. Model Selection & Training
    * Chose a ML model, explore deep learning (PyTorch/TensorFlow)
    * Train a Logistic Regression, Random Forest, or Naive Bayes classifier as a baseline.

1. Model Evaluation
    * Use precision, recall, and F1-score as performance metrics
    * Optimise hyperparameters using GridSearchCV
    * Compare multiple models and select the best one.

1. Deployment & Integration
    * Deploy the model via FastAPI/Flask (Web server) as an API endpoint
    * Integrate with existing systems to classify incoming incidents in real time
    * Store predictions in a database/log file for review

## Concepts & Tools Required

Python Modules: scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, nltk, spacy
ML Basics: Train-test split, feature extraction (TF-IDF, embeddings), classification models
Evaluation Metrics: Precision, recall, F1-score, confusion matrix
Deployment: FastAPI, Flask, Docker (optional)
LLMs vs Traditional ML: If the dataset is large, LLMs can enhance contextual understanding.
